## Our vision  
We envision an easy to implement open-source solution for storing your hoards of data.  
Our solution can be run by almost anyone, anywhere; including on our own web platform.  
And our product will make use of Machine Learning to optimise compression - helping minimise disk usage, especially where space is a premium.
